Question:1 
Write a Python function count_words(sentence) that takes a string representing a sentence as input and returns a dictionary containing the count of each word in the sentence. Words are case-sensitive, and punctuation should be ignored. 
Example: 
Input: "Hello, world! This is a test. Hello, world!" 
Output: {'Hello': 2, 'world': 2, 'This': 1, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'test': 1} 
Your function should treat words with different capitalizations as different words, and it should ignore punctuation characters such as commas, periods, exclamation marks, etc.

Question:2 
Write a Python function flatten_list(lst) that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list. The flattened list should contain all the elements of the original list, but without any nesting. 
Example: 
Input: [[1, 2, [3]], 4, [5, [6, 7]]] 
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 
Your function should handle arbitrarily nested lists, and the order of elements in the flattened list should be the same as in the original list.
